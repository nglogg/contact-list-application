# Contact List Application

This is a simple contact list application built using ReactJS and TypeScript. The application includes the following features:

1. **List Entries**: It displays a list of contact entries using mock data.

2. **Filter and Search Entries**: Users can enter a search term to filter the list of contacts by name. The displayed list is updated immediately based on the search term.

3. **Select an Entry**: Users can click on a contact's name to select it, which then displays additional contact details.

## Code Overview

- The application uses functional components and state management with React hooks.

- Mock contact data is provided using TypeScript interfaces.

- The `useState` hook is used to manage the application's state, including the list of contacts, the selected contact, and the search term.

- The `handleSelectContact` function sets the selected contact when a contact's name is clicked.

- The list of contacts is filtered and updated based on the search term.

- The UI includes input fields for searching, a list of contacts, and a section to display contact details when a contact is selected.
